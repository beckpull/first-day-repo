            <p>I am a junior software developer in training right now, and I have an extensive history doing many other exciting things such as living in the wilderness for to years (where I built my living structures out of the local pine trees) and working at a FBO (Fixed base Operation) pumping thousands of gallons of jet fuel into some of the coolest aircraft in this country. I am an adventure lover and a puzzle solver - and I am so very excited for my future endeavors!</p>
